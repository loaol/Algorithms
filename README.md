### Algorithms
------
When learning a skill, the best way is to practice and record the problems and solutions we have encountered in practice. The process can be very boring, but only then can we make progress continually.

So this repository for me is to record the problems and solutions in the learning algorithm and data structure, and to become skilled with the GitHub.
